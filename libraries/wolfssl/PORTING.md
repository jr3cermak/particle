# Porting notes 

This port is based on release version 3.11.0

# 2017-07-28

## Release 0.0.1

More documentation coming...

Finally figured out how libraries work in the Particle ecosystem.  Once you upload it,
the cloud magically knits your project together with the library as stated in 
library.properties.

To make your own customizations to the library, you need to use Particle CLI to
download a copy, make your modifications and upload a private copy that you will
compile against.

In the Particle framework, when you try to combine wolfssl and wolfmqtt, we
have certain conflicts that we need to avoid.  We will now bring in
wolfmqtt into wolfssl piecemeal so we can avoid breakage.

# Unpacking

Run the script in IDE/ARDUINO to setup the code base (wolfssl-arduino.sh).

Populate `src/` tree:

cp *.c -> *.cpp
cp -a wolfssl `src/`

I created a helper script to do these parts.  That script is in the 
`bin/` directory.  Edit variables for correct paths in `mklibwolfssl`
before running.

# Setup

## src/wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h

Define a few things.

My suggestion is use one of the ARM settings.  The
`WOLFSSL_IAR_ARM` correctly does not pull in the sys/socket.h
header file.  `NO_OLD_RNGNAME` avoids a redefinition conflict
with the Particle firmware that uses `RNG`.

`TIME_OVERRIDE` gets around this nasty symbol problem.

`/usr/local/gcc-arm-embedded/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/4.8.4/../../../../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7-m/libg_s.a(lib_a-gettimeofdayr.o): In function `_gettimeofday_r':
gettimeofdayr.c:(.text._gettimeofday_r+0xe): undefined reference to `_gettimeofday'`

Final defines:

```
#define WOLFSSL_IAR_ARM
#define WOLFSSL_PARTICLE_ARM
#define NO_OLD_RNGNAME
#define TIME_OVERRIDE
```

# Code changes

## example/wolfssl_client

### wolfssl_client.ino

Comment out `#include <Ethernet.h>` and replace `EthernetClient client;`
with `TCPClient client;`

## Base code

### internal.h / internal.cpp

Use `WOLFSSL_PARTICLE_ARM` to mark Particle specific items.

Need to define the following routines with use of `TIME_OVERRIDE`.

XTIME(): simply plug into the device time

XGMTIME(): Pulled code from newlib libc.

* Need to use pieces of gmtime_r() and portions of local.h

### src/misc.cpp

Create a symbolic link between src/misc.cpp and
wolfcrypt/src/misc.c

### ssl.h

`src/wolfssl/ssl.h:2328:13: error: 'size_t' does not name a type`

Add "application.h" to ssl.h.  
[REF](https://community.particle.io/t/digole-uart-i2c-spi-display-library/2392/281?u=cermak)

### ssl.cpp

One alloc to cast using given defines.

`rng = (WC_RNG*) XMALLOC(sizeof(WC_RNG), ctx->heap, DYNAMIC_TYPE_RNG);`
