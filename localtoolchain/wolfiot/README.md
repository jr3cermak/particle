# wolfiot.cpp

This allows you to overlay SSL on top of the TCPClient.  This particular
example allows you to work with the AWS IoT.   This is a very bare bones
example that just got working on 2017-07-21.

# wolfiot/inc/Private.h

This is currently where you set the AWS IoT hostname and certificates to communicate
with the AWT IoT service.  The certificate strings must have linefeeds to be parsed
correctly.  The certificate type can be either PEM or DER.  See Chapter 7 of the
[wolfssl](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfSSL/Docs-wolfssl-manual-7-keys-and-certificates.html)
documentation.  The certificates are generated by AWS IoT upon creation of the thingy
and its credentials.

```
/* Configuration */
#define DEFAULT_MQTT_HOST       "data.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com" /* broker.hivemq.com */

// CA CERT
const unsigned char CAcert[] = "\
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n\
MIIE0z....\n\
....
-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";

// CERT
const unsigned char CLcert[] = "\
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n\
MIIDW....\n\
....
-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";

// PRIVATE KEY
const unsigned char PRcert[] = "\
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\
MIIE...\n\
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n";
```
